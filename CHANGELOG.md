# Changelog

All notable changes to **grouter** are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The dashboard reads this file directly from
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GXDEVS/grouter/main/CHANGELOG.md`
to surface release notes and notify when a newer version is available.

## [Unreleased]

## [5.7.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Kiro: AWS rejecting tokens after ~8h** — the chat handler's Kiro
  branch read the bearer from `selected` (the pre-refresh account
  snapshot) instead of `account` (the post-refresh result of
  `checkAndRefreshAccount`). Worked right after sign-in while the
  original token was still valid, then started failing with `The bearer
  token included in the request is invalid` once AWS expired it. Bug
  dates back to the Kiro MVP (#44) but only surfaced now as token
  lifetimes elapsed in the wild. All other providers were already
  reading from `account`.

## [5.7.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **`grouter up <platform>` for OpenCode, Cline, and OpenClaw** — the `up`
  command now ships three new adapters in addition to OpenClaude:
  - `grouter up opencode` writes/merges
    `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` with a custom `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`
    provider named `grouter`, pointing at the local proxy. Honours
    `OPENCODE_CONFIG`. Existing config (mcp servers, other providers, etc.) is
    preserved.
  - `grouter up cline` shells out to the `cline` CLI
    (`cline auth -p openai -k grouter -b http://localhost:<port>/v1 -m <model>`).
    If the binary isn't on `PATH`, prints install instructions and the manual
    settings to use in the VS Code extension.
  - `grouter up openclaw` writes/merges `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under
    `agents.defaults.models["grouter/<model>"]`. Honours `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`
    and `OPENCLAW_HOME`. Sets the entry as `primary` only if the user hasn't
    already configured one.
  Each adapter supports the same flags as `up openclaude` — `--provider`,
  `--model`, `--port`, `--no-interactive`, `--remove`.
- **Restart server button** in the dashboard topbar — connected to the
  existing Stop server control as a button group (refresh icon on the
  right). Clicking it hits a new `POST /api/proxy/restart` endpoint that
  spawns a detached `serve restart` helper (since the dashboard runs
  inside the daemon and can't both kill itself and respawn). The button
  spins, both controls disable, auto-poll pauses, and the UI polls
  `/api/status` every 600ms (25s deadline) until the new daemon answers,
  then resumes auto-poll.
- **Custom Providers CRUD on the dashboard** — the existing "Add custom
  provider" flow is now a full section under the Providers tab with
  inline cards. Each custom provider can be edited (name, base URL,
  iconify icon, accent color) or removed. Removing also drops every
  connection registered under that provider and releases the per-provider
  port. New endpoints: `PATCH /api/providers/custom/:id` and
  `DELETE /api/providers/custom/:id`. Modal gains an icon-preset grid
  (12 iconify IDs) plus a color picker with quick-swatch presets.
- **KiloCode live model catalog** — `fetchAndSaveProviderModels("kilocode")`
  now hits `https://api.kilo.ai/api/gateway/models` and translates the
  upstream `{ data[].isFree, data[].pricing }` schema into our internal
  shape (KiloCode does not serve OpenAI's `/v1/models`). Registry-listed
  premium IDs (Anthropic Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, kilo-auto/frontier) are
  always merged in even when missing from the gateway response.

### Changed
- **`up` wizard refactor** — provider/model picker extracted into
  `src/commands/up-shared.ts` (`pickProviderAndModel`, `resolveTarget`,
  `printActiveConfig`, `printWriteReport`). Each platform adapter is now ~150
  lines focused only on its own config-file shape; `openclaude.ts` keeps the
  shell-rc / settings.json injection it always had.
- **KiloCode credits warning** — KiloCode markets a "free OAuth tier"
  but premium models (Anthropic Claude family, `kilo-auto/frontier`)
  consume the ~$20 of signup credits, which burn fast on Opus/Sonnet. The
  CLI picker now shows `$ credits` next to those entries instead of
  `FREE`, `up <platform>` prints a yellow warning block before writing
  the config, and the dashboard provider modal shows a credits banner
  explaining which models stay free (`:free` suffix, `kilo-auto/free`,
  `openrouter/free`) versus which consume credits. KiloCode's registry
  list was also refreshed to reflect the 12 currently-free models plus
  Opus/Sonnet/Haiku 4.6.
- **Dashboard UI polish**:
  - Language pickers (desktop sidebar + mobile drawer) now show the
    country flag of the selected locale via `circle-flags:*` instead of
    a generic globe — `us` for English, `br` for Portuguese, `cn` for
    Chinese — and update on switch.
  - The "view models" button in the Providers tab now uses
    `solar:settings-bold-duotone` instead of the list icon.
  - The footer version (`v5.6.0`) is now rendered as a pill badge with
    the brand teal border + soft fill, so it reads as a tag rather than
    inline text.
  - **Update banner relocated** — the old fixed top bar is gone. Now a
    1:1 square card in the sidebar (above the language picker) with a
    Solar bold-duotone download icon, `vCURRENT → vLATEST` line, a
    BUN/NPM tab toggle, and a copy button that ships the right install
    command for the selected runtime. Dismiss is per-version (a new
    `latest` re-shows the card). Mirrored in the mobile drawer.

## [5.6.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Dashboard Changelog tab** — sidebar entry that fetches `CHANGELOG.md`
  from the GitHub raw URL, caches it for 30 minutes in the settings table,
  and parses it into per-version sections. Shows an update banner and a
  "New" badge when the running build is behind the latest release. The
  file is also embedded in the binary so the tab works offline before the
  cache warms.
- **Kiro translator** — `/v1/chat/completions` requests with
  `model: kiro/...` are routed through `@aws/codewhisperer-streaming-client`
  using the existing OAuth account. Both `stream=false` (single
  OpenAI-compatible response) and `stream=true` (native SSE — each
  upstream `assistantResponseEvent` is forwarded as its own
  `chat.completion.chunk` in real time, with role/content/finish chunks
  and usage on the final delta) are supported. Tool calls and
  `reasoningContentEvent` are still skipped.

### Changed
- **Kiro model routing** — `kiro/<model>` now forwards `<model>` to the
  upstream `userInputMessage.modelId`, so picking `kiro/deepseek-3.2` or
  `kiro/claude-haiku-4.5` actually selects that model instead of always
  falling through to the server's default.

### Fixed
- **Kiro client cancellation** — `AbortSignal` from the proxy is now
  forwarded to the AWS SDK call, so a client disconnect mid-request
  actually cancels the upstream work instead of leaking the connection
  until completion.

## [5.5.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **`/v1/messages` endpoint** — full Anthropic Messages API support on the
  router and per-provider listeners. Translates Anthropic ↔ OpenAI in both
  directions (request body, non-stream response, SSE stream).
- **Headless OAuth callback mode** — set `GROUTER_PUBLIC_URL=https://your.host`
  to route OAuth redirects through `<PUBLIC_URL>/oauth/callback` instead of an
  ephemeral local listener. Works in K8s/VPS/containers where the user's
  browser cannot reach the container's localhost.
- **`grouter add --callback-host <host> [--callback-port <port>]`** — force a
  specific bind for the OAuth listener. Manual paste prompt opens after 8s if
  the callback never reaches the listener.
- **`API.md`** committed to the repo with the full HTTP reference (status,
  models, chat completions, messages, auth flows, CORS).

### Fixed
- `grouter list` and other CLI commands no longer hang for ~5 minutes — the
  orchestrator session sweeper is now `unref()`-ed.

## [5.4.0] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- **Modular proxy split** — `src/proxy/server.ts` is now a slim router; the
  hardened `handleChatCompletions` lives in `src/proxy/chat-handler.ts` and
  shared state (`DISABLED_PROVIDER_IDS`) in `src/proxy/server-helpers.ts`.

### Added
- **3-layer upstream timeouts** via `AbortController`: 20s first-byte, 45s
  stream-idle, 120s total request.
- **Provider-specific recovery paths** — Codex `-high` model fallback, Codex
  401 retry (drop `ChatGPT-Account-ID` + forced refresh), Gemini capacity
  fallback (3.1-pro → 2.5-pro → 2.5-flash), large-request body trim and
  history compaction.
- **Refined fallback semantics** — auth failures (401/402/403) rotate without
  long cooldowns; rate limits (429 + structured markers) get exponential
  backoff up to level 15; transient 5xx get 5s cooldown.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Free-tier providers** — gate models exposed by `provider_free_only_<id>`.
- **Custom model picker** in the wizard.
- **Codex translator** — translate Claude-style upstream into OpenAI
  `chat.completions` SSE/non-stream.
- **Provider under-construction state** in the registry; SambaNova is gated
  while its OAuth flow is being reviewed.

### Fixed
- Docker install lifecycle — skip the install hook so `prebuild` doesn't run
  before `scripts/` is copied into the image.

## [5.2.2] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- Codex OAuth flow + proxy compatibility hardening.

### Added
- Dashboard now shows the running version dynamically (no more hardcoded
  "5.x").

## [5.2.1] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- `npm install -g grouter-auth` now works — `bin` points to `dist/grouter`
  instead of the missing source path.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Advanced Client API Keys** — per-key permissions, expiry, rate limits.
- **Custom Providers** — define your own OpenAI-compatible upstream from the
  dashboard.
- **OpenRouter enhancements** — refreshed model catalog and pricing.

### Fixed
- Removed hardcoded `qwen` as the default provider in several code paths.
- Dashboard language switching is now instant and persists across reloads;
  fixed a race condition that occasionally swapped languages mid-render.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- First public **grouter** release after the rebrand from `gqwen-auth`.
- 15+ provider catalogue (Qwen, Claude, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Kimi,
  Kiro, KiloCode, GitLab Duo, Cursor, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, …).
- Single-file Bun binary build (`bun build --target bun`).
- SQLite state in `~/.grouter/grouter.db` with idempotent silent migrations.
- Dashboard + setup wizard served from the embedded HTML files.
